## Setting up the Database in FastAPI 
1) Firstly setup the database you want to use.Eg
   
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "DBMS://username:password@host/database_name"
eg:"postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:9999@localhost/aron" 
2) Now you need to create engine :{The create_engine function is used to create an instance of a database engine. It takes a connection URL (SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL) as its first argument, which specifies the database connection string. This connection string contains information like the database type (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), host, port, username, password, and database name. The future=True argument enables SQLAlchemy's Future feature, which allows for asynchronous database operations.}{
This line creates an SQLAlchemy engine instance called engine. The create_engine function is used to create a new engine that connects to the database specified in SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, which is the connection string for the database. The connect_args={} argument can be used to specify any extra arguments to be passed to the database driver during the connection, but in this case, it's left empty. The future=True argument enables SQLAlchemy's Future feature, allowing asynchronous database operations.
}
3) Create a session local : SessionLocal is an instance of sessionmaker, which is a factory class for creating new SQLAlchemy sessions. A session represents a transactional scope that communicates with the database. The autocommit and autoflush parameters are set to False, which means the session will not automatically commit changes to the database or flush pending changes to the database before executing a query. Setting bind=engine associates the session with the engine, so all operations performed within this session will use the specified database engine.
{
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine, future=True): This line creates an SQLAlchemy sessionmaker called SessionLocal. The sessionmaker is a factory for creating new sessions. The autocommit=False means that the session will not automatically commit transactions, and autoflush=False means that it won't automatically flush pending changes to the database. The bind=engine argument associates the session with the engine created earlier, so all operations performed within this session will use the specified database engine. The future=True argument enables asynchronous database operations for the session.
}
4) Create Base : Base is an instance of declarative_base, which is used to define the base class for all the ORM model classes. It allows you to create Python classes that map to database tables.When defining ORM models, you should inherit from this base class.
5) Create DB Utility : This is a utility function called get_db. It's a generator function that provides a database session (db) to be used within a request or operation. The function uses the SessionLocal sessionmaker to create a new session (db) and then yields it to the calling function or route. After the yield statement, the session is automatically closed using the finally block, ensuring proper cleanup of resources. This pattern is often used in web frameworks like FastAPI to manage database sessions during HTTP requests.
6)user_model.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine): This line invokes the create_all method on the metadata attribute of the Base class associated with the user_model. It creates the database table corresponding to the user_model class in the database specified by the engine. Similarly, course_model.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) creates the table for the course_model class.

async def get_user_course(user_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)): ...: This is an asynchronous function called get_user_course, which takes two parameters: user_id of type int and db of type Session. The db parameter is a dependency injection that will automatically provide the database session (db) to this function. The Depends(get_db) means that this function depends on the get_db function, and FastAPI will call get_db to provide the database session to this route function.

Depends(get_db): This indicates that the db parameter will be populated by calling the get_db function using the Depends mechanism. The Depends mechanism is typically used in combination with a framework like FastAPI to handle dependency injection. It ensures that a new database session is created for each request and is properly closed after the request is processed.
